Tested on a Pi Zero W with an RTL-SDR and LCD display. 

Uses the [Dump1090](https://github.com/antirez/dump1090) mode S decoder library - I hope to minimally reimpliment this this some day.

Displays carrier name, aircraft type, origin country, and origin airport.

Update coordinates in track.py for the region you want to filter over.
